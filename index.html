					The purpose of the Grundy County Community Organizations Active in Disaster (Grundy COAD) is to enhance the efforts of
					member organizations through inter-agency planning, relief, response and recovery activities, all directed toward the
					goal of giving area residents adequate and timely services, impartially and uniformly delivered, when a disaster strikes
					Grundy County, Illinois. Guided by the core principles of the 4Cs – Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and
					Collaboration. Grundy COAD members provide the leadership that builds strong, resilient communities and delivers hope in
					times of need. The Grundy COAD is a coordinating organization and will not assume direct operational responsibilities
					during any disaster situation. Grundy COAD exists to foster better service by its members to communities struck by
					disaster. This is done through preparedness activities that include planning among Grundy COAD members and providing
					education to the general public, and by responding to and helping the communities of Grundy County recover from
					disaster.
